This is a list of all the bugs I ran into during the development of this app.

BUG:
  ```Asset `application.css` was not declared to be precompiled in production.
  Declare links to your assets in `app/assets/config/manifest.js`.
  //= link application.css
  and restart your server```
FIX:
  switched the `/app/assets/config/manifest.js` from `//= link_directory ..stylesheets.css`
  to...
  `//= link application.css`


BUG:
  Tailwind navbar dropdown menu stuck and the button refactoring is not available in vanilla js
