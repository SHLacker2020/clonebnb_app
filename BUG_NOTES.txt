This is a list of all the bugs I ran into during the development of this app.

BUG:
```Asset `application.css` was not declared to be precompiled in production.
Declare links to your assets in `app/assets/config/manifest.js`.

  //= link application.css

and restart your server```
FIX:
switched the `/app/assets/config/manifest.js` from `//= link_directory ..stylesheets.css`
to...
`//= link application.css`
