This is a list of all the bugs I ran into during the development of this app.

BUG:
  - ```Asset `application.css` was not declared to be precompiled in production.
    Declare links to your assets in `app/assets/config/manifest.js`.
    //= link application.css
    and restart your server```
FIX:
  - switched the `/app/assets/config/manifest.js` from `//= link_directory ..stylesheets.css`
    to...
    `//= link application.css`



BUG:
  - Tailwind navbar dropdown menu stuck and the button refactoring is not available in vanilla js
FIX:
  - run `./bin/importmap pin el-transition`
  - make sure this line `pin "el-transition", to: "https://ga.jspm.io/npm:el-transition@0.0.7/index.js"`
    has been added to the `/config/importmap.rb` file.
  - choose the actual div that will be appearing for the menu, and create a callback function for it with the transitions
  - provided here... https://github.com/mmccall10/el-transition



BUG:
  - TDD RSPEC Fail:
    -   1) Homes GET /index succeeds
     Failure/Error: <%= stylesheet_link_tag "tailwind", "inter-font", "data-turbo-track": "reload" %>

          ------------------------------------------^
FIX:
  - Add `config.assets.css_compressor = nil` to `/config/environments/test.rb`
